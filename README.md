# Sitan Web App

This repository is home of the sitan web application, an open source dotnet application for enabling self sovereign identity (SSI), inspired by and using the [aries-framework-dotnet](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet).

This web application is intended to serve as an enterprise agent capable of issuing credentials, requesting, and verifying proofs.

A validator nodes pool is where the ledger is stored and consensus is implemented. It is a prerequisite for verification of credentials to be possible. Please see [indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) repositiory for more details.
